``supysonic-server`` [``--server`` ``gevent``\|\ ``gunicorn``\|\ ``waitress``]

[``--processes`` `n`] [``--threads`` `n`]

Description
===========

``supysonic-server`` is the main Supysonic's component, allowing to serve
content to clients. It is actually a basic wrapper over ``Gevent``, ``Gunicorn``
or ``Waitress``, requiring at least one of them to be installed to run.

Options
=======

-S name, --server name
   Specify which WSGI server to use. `name` must be one of ``gevent``,
   ``gunicorn`` or ``waitress`` and the matching package must then be installed.
   If the option isn't provided, the first one available will be used.

-h hostname, --host hostname
   Hostname or IP address on which to listen. The default is ``0.0.0.0`` which
   means to listen on all IPv4 interfaces on this host.
   Cannot be used with ``--socket``.

-p port, --port port
   TCP port on which to listen. Default is ``5722``.
   Cannot be used with ``--socket``.

-s path, --socket path
   Path of a Unix socket on which to bind to. If a path is specified, a Unix
   domain socket is made instead of the usual inet domain socket.
   Cannot be used with ``--host`` or ``--port``.
   Not available on Windows.

--processes n
   Number of worker processes to spawn. Only applicable when using the
   ``Gunicorn`` WSGI server (``--server gunicorn``).

--threads n
   The number of worker threads for handling requests. Only applicable when
   using the ``Gunicorn`` or ``Waitress`` WSGI server (``--server gunicorn`` or
   ``--server waitress``)
