Supysonic setup
===============

This guide details the required steps to get a Supysonic instance ready to
start serving your music.

TL;DR
-----

For the impatient, here's a quick summary to get Supysonic installed and ready
to start serving (but this doesn't create any user nor specifies where your
music is located üòè). This uses `gunicorn`__, but there are
:doc:`other options <deploying/index>`.

::

   pip install git+https://github.com/spl0k/supysonic.git
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 "supysonic.web:create_application()"

Another solution rather than going through the whole setup process yourself is
to use a ready-to-use Docker image. While we don't provide images for Supysonic,
that didn't keep the community from creating some. Take a look on the
`Docker Hub`__ and pick one you like. For more details on their usage, please
refer to the readme of said images.
